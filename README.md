# Multinomial Naive Bayes Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a simple implementation of Multinomial Naive Bayes using Python. The notebook walks through the steps of loading data, preprocessing, training the model, and visualizing the results. Alongside the Jupyter Notebook, there is also a corresponding .py python file.
The Naive Bayes folder contains the following files:
- A .ipynb file (Jupyter Notebook) that contains all the code regarding the assignment including text blocks explaining portions of the code
- A corresponding .py file
- A .png file that is a screenshot of the confusion matrix of the Naive Bayes model when run on the test dataset
- Three .csv files (emotion_train_data.csv, emotion_validation_data.csv and emotion_test_data.csv) that contain all the raw data on which the Naive Bayes model is trained and tested. You can download and save the .csv file in your computer and open it as an Excel file for better readability.

## Introduction

Multinomial Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, commonly used for text classification. It assumes features (e.g., word frequencies) follow a multinomial distribution and are conditionally independent given the class. This simplicity makes it efficient and effective for tasks like spam detection or sentiment analysis. This assignment provides a clear and concise example of how to implement Naive Bayes from scratch using Python. The assignment explores how to classify a dataset of tweets into different categories of sentiments.

## Installation Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- regex
- sklearn
- nltk
- datasets

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
 pip install numpy
```
```bash
 pip install pandas
```
```bash
 pip install matplotlib 
```
```bash
 pip install seaborn
```
```bash
 pip install matplotlib
```
```bash
 pip install regex
```
```bash
 pip install sklearn
```

To install the datasets and nltk libraries, simply run the first code block in the Jupyter Notebook. Running this cell may take some time (approximately 2 to 5 minutes for the first time you run it).

## Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1) Introduction: Overview of the project objectives <br>
2) Library Imports: Importing all the libaries needed for the assignment <br>
3) Data Loading: Steps to load the dataset. <br>
4) Data Preprocessing: Steps to preprocess the dataset <br>
5) Model Implementation: Training the Naive Bayes model. <br>
6) Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model performance on the validation dataset and then on the test dataset <br>
7) Implementation of the Sklearn version of the Model

## Data

**Tweet Evaluation Dataset**: Instead of downloading the dataset manually, we will be using the [`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets) library from Hugging Face to automatically download and manage the Tweet Eval dataset. This library is part of the Hugging Face ecosystem, widely used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The `datasets` library not only downloads the dataset but also offers a standardized interface for accessing and handling the data, making it compatible with other popular libraries like Pandas and PyTorch. 

The three .csv files given in this repository were downloaded by running the code block under the 'Loading Dataset' markdown in the Jupyter Notebook. The dataset has two columns: `text` and `label`, where `text` is the sentence and `label` is the emotion label. The goal is to classify tweets into various emotional categories (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) by analyzing their content.

You can explore the extensive list of datasets available on Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets).


## Training and Visualization

The entire training process alongside the maths involved is explained in detail in the jupyter notebook. 
- Note: A good knowledge of Probability is required to fully understand the Naive Bayes algorithm, especially the concept of conditional probabilties and Bayes' Theorm.

## Lessons

A Naive Bayes assignment can teach a variety of valuable skills and concepts, including:

### 1. **Understanding the Naive Bayes Assumption**
   - The project reinforces the assumption that features (words in text classification) are **conditionally independent** given the class. While this is rarely true in real-world data, Naive Bayes still performs well because it captures dominant word distributions effectively.

### 2. **Importance of Data Preprocessing**
   - The impact of **cleaning and preprocessing text** (removing URLs, stopwords, punctuation, and lowercasing) is crucial for improving classification performance. The project highlights how these steps affect the modelâ€™s ability to generalize.

### 3. **Vectorization and Feature Representation Matter**
   - Implementing **Bag of Words (BoW)** demonstrates how transforming text into numerical data is essential for machine learning models. 

### 4. **Evaluating Model Performance with Metrics**
   - Using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices** highlights the strengths and weaknesses of Naive Bayes. For instance, if the dataset has imbalanced classes, accuracy alone may not be the best metric.
